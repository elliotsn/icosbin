modeled fields of view', Submitted to Icarus for publication.

File inventory:

make_icosbin.sh   - Builds the FORTRAN programs. Requires the Intel ifort and icc 
                    compilers.
bin_data.csh      - Script to run the raw modelled EFOVs through the binning pipeline.
c7_171_176_83_85* - Files with this stem contain EFOVs that are raw (.rfile) and 
                    binned and linked (.gfile, .ofile). Files with the extension .des
                    are descriptor files, headers for the binary data files.
ptrinum.f         - Assigns a triangle number to each record based on the records'
                    lat and lon.
ptrigather.f      - Gathers and averages parts of EFOVs that reside in the same
                    triangular bin on the icosahedral grid.
ptrilink.f        - Within one obseravtion, separates the invariant fields in the 
                    record from the variant ones and writes observations as entries
                    in a linked list. One record per observation is stored in *.ofile.
                    One record per triangle in each observation is stored in *.gfile.
